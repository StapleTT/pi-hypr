# pi-hypr

This script is essentially a clone of my sway dotfiles but adjusted for hyprland on Manjaro ARM. Don't really see a point in rewriting a description for something less practical.

## Compatibility
This script was specifically designed for 64-bit Raspberry Pi models running the latest development version of Manjaro ARM. While compatibility with other aarch64 Arch-based distributions should generally work, compatibility with arm64 architectures is not guaranteed. Use with other systems may require additional modifications or troubleshooting.

## Installation
To get started, run the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/StapleTT/pi-hypr
cd pi-hypr
./install.sh
```
